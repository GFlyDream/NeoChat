<p>
  This release represents this app's transition into maturity and stability. To allow for more advanced querying and complex database operations, we decided to make the switch from <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/database">Firebase Realtime Database</a> to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore"> Firebase Firestore</a>. Using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage"> Firebase Storage</a>, we introduced image messaging into the chat itself, bringing NeoChat's ability to the next level.<br> We also made significant changes to the chat UI layout (see img 1 and img 2). While there are still a lot of work to do before we can reach a stable public release, I can say that we are proud of the work we were able to achieve to date.
